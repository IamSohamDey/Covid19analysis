          <h2>Transmission</h2>
          <p>COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that are expelled when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouth or nose of someone nearby, or they can be inhaled into the lungs. COVID-19 can also be spread by touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the world since it first emerged in late 2019. The virus has spread rapidly, causing illness and death, and disrupting economies, social interactions, and daily life in almost every country. With over 473 million cases and 6 million deaths reported globally as of March 2023, the pandemic has highlighted existing health and social inequalities and underscored the need for more resilient societies.

          <p>As of March 2023, over 473 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, with over 6 million deaths. While vaccination efforts have been underway in many countries, there are still areas where the virus is spreading rapidly, particularly in low-income countries where vaccination rates are low. The emergence of new variants of the virus has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of existing vaccines and the potential for future waves of the pandemic</p>
